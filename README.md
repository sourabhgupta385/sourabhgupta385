### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a DevOps engineer who loves to do automation in all the work. I have experience in automating and optimizing critical deployments on cloud platforms, leveraging configuration management, CI/CD, and DevOps processes. Right now, I'm working with Infosys's client Services Australia to create DevOps solution for their newly starting project, a government portal that offers policies and payments solution in the country.
